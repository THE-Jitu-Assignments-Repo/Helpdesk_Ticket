HelpDesk-T project is a web-based helpdesk application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS). 
The application is designed to provide support for individuals who are experiencing issues with their laptops.
Users can log in to the application, describe the issues they are facing with their laptops, and submit a support ticket.
The application includes user authentication and authorization, and it allows users to create, read, update and delete support tickets.
The user interface was built using ReactJS, which provides a dynamic and responsive user experience. MongoDB was used to store the data, 
and ExpressJS was used for handling server-side routing and API calls. NodeJS was used for the server-side logic and handling the application's logic. 
The project was developed with the goal of providing a simple and efficient way for users to get help with any product like laptops,
and it has been rigorously tested to ensure that it is fully functional and user-friendly.
